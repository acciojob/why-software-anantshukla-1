	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I want to become a developer because I am driven by the thrill of solving complex problems and the ability to build something meaningful from scratch. To me, coding is more than just writing lines of text; it is a powerful tool to create digital solutions that can impact people's daily lives. I have always admired how technology simplifies human effort, and I want to be at the forefront of that innovation. Furthermore, the field of software development offers a unique environment of continuous learning where every challenge is an opportunity to sharpen my logic and creativity. This perfect blend of analytical thinking and creative expression is what motivates me to build a long-term career in this industry.
